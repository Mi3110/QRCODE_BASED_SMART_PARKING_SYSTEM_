# QRCODE_BASED_SMART_PARKING_SYSTEM_



In the modern era of rapid growth and development, the demand for cars has increased gradually. With the demand, the problem of finding the appropriate parking space is now a key challenge. To remember the place where one has parked the car in the crowd of 500-600 cars is a troublesome situation for anyone. Unwanted use of parking space because of the lack of feasibility and payment method leads to a huge loss for the vendors of parking space.
Finding an appropriate parking space needs a lot of time. The advanced developed parking ecosystem can solve much of the problem mentioned above. A hassle-free system will help both vendor and user to overcome most of the problem as well as it eases the payment method and saves time. The use of QR (Quick Response) code and a dedicated app can overcome the problems.
